# üõ°Ô∏è Simple File Integrity Checker

This is a basic file integrity checker script that uses **hashes** to detect changes in a file. It periodically calculates the file's hash and compares it with the previously saved hash. If it detects any changes, it throws an alert!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Considerations**
This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
Do **NOT** use this script to monitor files you don't own or don't have permission to track. Always respect privacy and adhere to legal guidelines.

## üíª **Setup Instructions**

### Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saahil-gupta/file-integrity-checker.git
cd simple-file-integrity-checker
```

### Run the Script
```bash
python file_checker.py
```

### Stopping the Checker
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop it

### How it Works
1. Calculates the SHA-256 hash of the specified file.
2. Saves the hash in a text file (file_hash.txt).
3. Periodically checks the file for changes (every 100 seconds by default).
4. Alerts if the current hash doesn't match the saved hash.
5. Updates the saved hash after detecting a change.

### üåü Customization
1. File to Monitor:
Change the file_path variable in the script to monitor a different file.

2. Check Interval:
Modify the interval variable to set how often it checks for changes.

3. Hash Type:
You can switch from SHA-256 to another hash algorithm (like MD5) by editing the calculate_hash() function:
```bash
sha256_hash = hashlib.md5()
```

4. Log Formatting:
Customize the alert message or log format by editing the print statements.
